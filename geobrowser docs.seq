	GEOÂROWSER V1.0 BY ÂO ÚIMMERMANÉNTRODUCTION:    GEOÂROWSER IS A ÇÅÏÓ V2.0 APPLICATION WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO VIEW MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF TEXT AND PICTURE DOCUMENTS WITHOUT LOADING THEIR RESPECTIVE APPLICATIONS AND WITHOUT HAVING TO TRANSLATE THEM INTO ANOTHER FILE TYPE.    GEOÂROWSER'S RESIZABLE, MOVABLE WINDOW SYSTEM SUPPORTS THE BROWSING AND VIEWING OF STANDARD ÃOMMODORE TEXT FILES IN ÓÅÑ FORMAT (OR ÐÒÇ FORMAT), STANDARD ÁÓÃÉÉ TEXT FILES IN ÓÅÑ OR ÐÒÇ FORMAT, GEO×RITE V2.0 AND V2.1 DOCUMENTS WITH SUPPORT FOR FONTS AND CLIP-ART, ÌOADÓTAR PACKED TEXT FILES, ÇÅÏÓ ÔEXT ÁLBUMS, ÇÅÏÓ ÐHOTO ÁLBUMS, AND ÇÅÏÓ ÎOTEPAD "ÎOTES" FILES.ÕSING THE GEOÂROWSER INTERFACE:    GEOÂROWSER IS EXECUTED BY DOUBLE-CLICKING ON ITS ICON FROM THE DESKÔOP.  ×HEN THE MAIN SCREEN COMES UP, YOU WILL SEE TWO DROP-DOWN MENUS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, AND TWO WINDOWS, ONE OF WHICH IS EMPTY.    ÔHE TWO MAIN MENU OPTIONS INCLUDE THE GEOS MENU, WHICH CONTAINS A "PROGRAM INFO" OPTION FOR VIEWING APPLICATION VERSION INFORMATION, AND OPTIONS FOR ANY DESK ACCESSORIES YOU MIGHT HAVE ON THE DISK FROM WHICH YOU LAUNCHED GEOÂROWSER.  ÔHE OTHER MENU OPTION IS THE FILE MENU, WHICH CONTAINS AN "OPEN" OPTION, FOR VIEWING A FILE SELECTED FROM THE FILE WINDOW (SEE BELOW), AND AN "EXIT" OPTION, WHICH EXITS FROM GEOÂROWSER AND RE-LOADS THE DESKÔOP.    ÄIRECTLY BELOW THE MENU IS THE ÆILE WINDOW AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE FILE WINDOW IS THE LARGER ÂROWSE WINDOW.  ÆIRST WE WILL EXPERIMENT ON USING THE WINDOWS AS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO.    ÅACH WINDOW IS DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL PARTS.  ÔHE TOP PART OF EACH WINDOW, A HORIZONTAL BAR CONTAINING MANY HORIZONTAL LINES, IS THE ÔITLE BAR.  ÏN THE RIGHT SIDE OF EACH TITLE BAR IS A SQUARE BOX WHICH IS THE ÃLOSE BUTTON. ÓTRETCHING VERTICALLY ALONG THE RIGHT SIDE OF EACH WINDOW IS THE ÐAGE BAR WITH TWO PAGE ARROW BUTTONS.  ÓTRETCHING HORIZONTALLY ALONG THE BOTTOM IS THE ÃOMMAND BAR WHICH MAY CONTAIN SOME BUTTONS.  ÔHE SMALL BOX IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT OF THE WINDOW, WHERE THE ÐAGE BAR AND THE ÃOMMAND BAR INTERSECT, IS THE ÒESIZING WIDGET. ÔHE REST OF THE WINDOW IS THE VIEWING AREA.    ÉN ORDER TO USE A PARTICULAR WINDOW, THE USER MUST FIRST ACTIVATE THAT WINDOW.  ×HEN GEOÂROWSER FIRST LOADS, THE ÆILE WINDOW IS THE ACTIVE WINDOW. Á WINDOW IS ACTIVATED BY CLICKING ANYWHERE INSIDE THE WINDOW.  ÏNCE ACTIVATED, ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS AND BUTTONS IN THAT WINDOW MAY BE USED.  ÁCTIVATING A WINDOW WILL AUTOMATICALLY DE-ACTIVATE THE OTHER WINDOW.  ÓINCE THE TWO WINDOWS MAY OVERLAP EACH OTHER AT TIMES, THE ACTIVE WINDOW WILL ALWAYS BE THE ONE ON TOP AND IN THE FOREGROUND.    ÁN ACTIVATED WINDOW MAY BE MOVED AROUND ON THE SCREEN USING YOUR MOUSE OR OTHER ÇÅÏÓ POINTING DEVICE.  Á WINDOW IS MOVED BY HOLDING DOWN THE MOUSE BUTTON INSIDE OF THE ACTIVE WINDOW'S TITLE BAR AND MOVING THE MOUSE.  ÔHE USER WILL NOTICE THE WINDOW PARTIALLY REDRAWS ITSELF AS THE MOUSE IS MOVED.  ×HEN THE WINDOW IS AT THE DESIRED PLACE ON THE SCREEN, SIMPLY RELEASE THE MOUSE BUTTON.  ÔHE WINDOW WILL THEN COMPLETELY REDRAW AND STAY PUT.  ÂE CAREFUL NOT TO TRY AND MOVE A WINDOW ON TOP OF THE MENU AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN.    ÁN ACTIVATED WINDOW MAY BE MADE BIGGER OR SMALLER USING THE RESIZING WIDGET, WHICH IS THE SQUARE ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF EACH WINDOW.  ÔO RESIZE A WINDOW, HOLD DOWN THE MOUSE BUTTON INSIDE OF THE RESIZING WIDGET AND BEGIN MOVING THE MOUSE.  ÙOU WILL NOTICE THE WINDOW PARTIALLY REDRAWING ITSELF TO THE NEW SIZE YOU ARE SETTING FOR IT.  ×HEN THE WINDOW IS THE SIZE AND SHAPE YOU DESIRE, RELEASE THE MOUSE BUTTON AND THE WINDOW WILL COMPLETE ITS REDRAWING.ÕSING THE ÆILE WINDOW:    ÔHE LEFT-MOST WINDOW WHEN GEOÂROWSER FIRST LOADS IS THE ÆILE WINDOW.  ÔHIS WINDOW CONTAINS A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL THE FILES FOUND ON THE ACTIVE DISK DRIVE.  ×HEN MORE FILES ARE ON THE DISK THAN WILL FIT IN THE WINDOW, YOU MAY USE THE BOTTOM ÐAGE ARROW BUTTON TO GO TO THE NEXT PAGE OF FILE NAMES.  ÔHE TOP "UP" ÐAGE ARROW BUTTON WILL GO BACK TO A PREVIOUS PAGE OF FILE NAMES.    ÔHE FILE WINDOW ALSO CONTAINS EITHER ONE OR TWO BUTTONS INSIDE ITS BOTTOM ÃOMMAND BAR.  ÏNE BUTTON IS THE "ÄRIVE" BUTTON.  ÉF YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE DRIVE HOOKED UP, THIS BUTTON WILL OPEN UP A DISK IN THE NEXT DRIVE FROM Á TO Â TO Ã AND BACK TO Á.  ÉF YOU HAVE OPENED A DRIVE OTHER THAN THE ONE YOU BOOTED GEOÂROWSER OFF OF, YOU WILL ALSO SEE A "ÄISK" BUTTON.  ÔHIS BUTTON WILL PROMPT YOU TO INSERT A NEW DISK INTO THE CURRENT DRIVE AND THEN ALLOW YOU TO BROWSE THE FILES ON THAT DISK.    ÔHE FILES LISTED MAY BE OPENED FOR BROWSING IN ONE OF TWO WAYS.  ÔHE FIRST WAY IS TO SELECT A FILE BY CLICKING ONCE ON ITS NAME.  ÔHIS WILL HIGHLIGHT THE FILENAME.  ÆROM HERE, YOU CAN SELECT THE ÆILE MENU AND CLICK ON THE "OPEN" OPTION.  ÔHIS WILL OPEN THE FILE FOR BROWSING.  ÔHE SECOND WAY TO OPEN A FILE IS TO QUICKLY DOUBLE-CLICK ON THE NAME OF THE FILE.    ÔHE FILE WINDOW'S ÃLOSE BUTTON WILL SIMPLY DE-ACTIVATE THE FILE WINDOW AND ACTIVATE THE BROWSE WINDOW.ÕSING THE ÂROWSE WINDOW:    ÔHE LARGER WINDOW IS THE BROWSE WINDOW, AND IT IS WHERE THE TEXT AND GRAPHICS OF THE OPENED FILE MAY BE VIEWED.    ×HEN A FILE IS OPENED FROM THE ÆILE WINDOW, ITS NAME WILL APPEAR IN THE TITLE BAR OF THE BROWSE WINDOW.  ×HEN THIS TITLE BAR DOES NOT CONTAIN A FILE NAME, THEN NO FILE IS OPENED.  ÔHE TYPE OF FILE WILL BE AUTO-DETECTED BY GEOÂROWSER, SO YOU NEED NOT TELL GEOÂROWSER WHETHER THE FILE IS ÁÓÃÉÉ OR ÐÅÔÓËÉÉ OR ÌOADÓTAR PACKED, ETC.      ÔHE TEXT IN THE BROWSE WINDOW MAY BE SCROLLED THROUGH BY USING THE ÐAGE ARROW KEYS.  ÁLSO, THE TEXT IN A DOCUMENT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY WORD WRAPPED FOR YOU.  ÉF THE TEXT CONTAINS CARRIAGE RETURNS OF ITS OWN, IT MAY LOOK STRANGE.  ÒESIZING THE BROWSE WINDOW MAY HELP YOU OUT ON THIS.    GEO×RITE DOCUMENTS CONTAIN ÆONTS, DIFFERENT TEXT STYLES, TABS, AND CLIP-ART.  GEOÂROWSER SUPPORTS ALL OF THESE, BUT MAY HANDLE THEM DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU EXPECT.  ÆONTS ARE SUPPORTED SO LONG AS THE FONT IS NOT TOO LARGE TO FIT IN GEOÂROWSER'S FONT BUFFER.  ÁLSO, WHEN A CHANGE IN A TEXT STYLE (OUTLINE, BOLD, ITALICS, ETC) RESULTS IN A FONT BEING TALLER THAN IT WAS BEFORE, OR IF A FONT CHANGE MID-SENTENCE RESULTS IN A LARGER FONT BEING DISPLAYED, THE NEWLY STYLED WORD WILL BE MOVED DOWN SLIGHTLY IN THE WINDOW TO ACCOMODATE THE LINE ABOVE IT.  ÔABS WILL WORK EXACTLY AS THEY DO IN GEO×RITE, EXCEPT THAT TABS WHICH ARE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE BROWSE WINDOW (ROUGHLY BEYOND THE 6TH INCH), MAY BE WRAPPED TO THE NEXT LINE.  ÃLIP-ÁRT IS ALSO SUPPORTED, AND GEOÂROWSER WILL DO ITS BEST TO FIT AS MUCH OF THE PICTURE IN ITS WINDOW AS POSSIBLE.  ÈOWEVER, SOMETIMES GEOÂROWSER WILL RESERVE A WHOLE PAGE FOR A PICTURE WHEN IT CAN'T QUITE FIT ENOUGH OF IT ON THE CURRENT PAGE.  ÉN THESE CASES, JUST HIT THE DOWN PAGE ARROW TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE.    ÌOADÓTAR PACKED FILES ARE PREFIXED WITH A "P." IN THE FILE NAME AND ARE TYPICALLY IN ÐÒÇ FORMAT.  ÔHIS FORMAT CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT NOTICE, SO YOU SHOULD LOOK FOR UPDATES TO GEOÂROWSER WHENEVER ONE OF THESE FILES IS UNREADABLE.  ÙOU MAY ALSO WANT TO KEEP OLDER GEOÂROWSER'S TO READ PACKED FILES IN OLDER FORMATS.    ÔEXT ÁLBUMS AND ÐHOTO ÁLBUMS ARE SUPPORTED, BUT THE NAMES OF EACH OF THE SCRAPS WILL NOT BE SHOWN FROM GEOÂROWSER.  ÅACH "PAGE" IN THE BROWSE WINDOW WILL REPRESENT A RECORD IN THE ALBUM.  ÐHOTO SCRAPS FALL UNDER THE SAME RESTRICTIONS AS THEY DO IN GEO×RITE FILES; GEOÂROWSER WILL TRY TO SHOW AS MUCH OF THE PICTURE AS WILL FIT, THOUGH YOU MAY HAVE TO RESIZE THE BROWSE WINDOW TO SEE MORE OF A LARGER PICTURE.    ÔHE BROWSE WINDOW'S ÃLOSE BUTTON WILL CLOSE ANY FILE YOU HAVE OPENED AND RE-ACTIVATE THE FILE WINDOW.
